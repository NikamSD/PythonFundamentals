      "In March 2020, the release of 15.ai, a free web application created by an anonymous MIT researcher that could generate convincing character voices using minimal training data, marked one of the earliest popular use cases of generative AI.[31] The platform is credited as the first mainstream service to popularize AI voice cloning (audio deepfakes) in memes and content creation, influencing subsequent developments in voice AI technology.[32][33]\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2021, the emergence of DALL-E, a transformer-based generative model, marked an advance in AI-generated imagery.[34][better source needed] This was followed by the releases of Midjourney and Stable Diffusion in 2022, which further democratized access to high-quality artificial intelligence art creation from natural language prompts.[35] These systems can generate photorealistic images, artwork, and designs based on text descriptions, leading to widespread adoption among artists, designers, and the general public.\n",

      "In November 2022, the public release of ChatGPT popularized generative AI for general-purpose text-based tasks.[36] The system's ability to engage in natural conversations, generate creative content, assist with coding, and perform various analytical tasks captured global attention and sparked widespread discussion about AI's potential impact on work, education, and creativity.[37][38] As of 2023, generative AI remained \"still far from reaching the benchmark of 'general human intelligence'\" according to a paper in the Journal of Information Technology.[39]\n",

      "In a 2024 survey, Asia–Pacific countries were significantly more optimistic than Western societies about generative AI and show higher adoption rates. Despite expressing concerns about privacy and the pace of change, 68% of Asia-Pacific respondents believed that AI was having a positive impact on the world, compared to 57% globally.[40] According to a survey by SAS and Coleman Parkes Research, China in particular has emerged as a global leader in generative AI adoption, with 83% of Chinese respondents using the technology, exceeding both the global average of 54% and the U.S. rate of 65%. A UN report indicated that Chinese entities filed over 38,000 generative AI patents from 2014 to 2023, substantially surpassing the United States in patent applications.[41] A 2024 survey on the Chinese social app Soul reported that 18% of respondents born after 2000 used generative AI \"almost every day\", and that over 60% of respondents like or love AI-generated content, while less than 3% dislike or hate it.[42]\n",
      "\n",
      "By mid 2025, despite continued consumer growth, many companies were increasingly abandoning generative AI pilot projects as they had difficulties with integration, data quality and unmet returns, leading analysts at Gartner and The Economist to characterize the period as entering the Gartner hype cycle's \"trough of disillusionment\" phase.[43][44]\n",

      "Applications\n",
      "Notable types of generative AI models include generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and variational autoencoders (VAEs). Generative AI systems are multimodal if they can process multiple types of inputs or generate multiple types of outputs.[45][unreliable source?] For example, GPT-4o can both process and generate text, images and audio.[46][unreliable source?]\n",

      "Generative AI has made its appearance in a wide variety of industries, radically changing the dynamics of content creation, analysis, and delivery. In healthcare,[47] for instance, generative AI accelerates drug discovery by creating molecular structures with target characteristics[48] and generates radiology images for training diagnostic models. This ability not only enables faster and cheaper development but also enhances medical decision-making. In finance, generative AI services help create datasets and automate reports using natural language. It automates content creation, produces synthetic financial data, and tailors customer communications. It also powers chatbots and virtual agents. Collectively, these technologies enhance efficiency, reduce operational costs, and support data-driven decision-making in financial institutions.[49][unreliable source?] The media industry makes use of generative AI for numerous creative activities such as music composition, scriptwriting, video editing, and digital art. The educational sector is impacted as well, since the tools make learning personalized through creating quizzes, study aids, and essay composition. Both the teachers and the learners benefit from AI-based platforms that suit various learning patterns.[50] In the educational field, in Colombia, student use of Meta's generative AI programs resulted in a decline in scores.[51]\n",
